##  HI THERE!

I'm a self-driven full-stack developer and systems thinker from South Africa 🇿🇦. I specialize in building scalable, modular, and resilient backend systems—often from scratch.

While I started coding to build apps, I’ve grown to love designing systems: APIs, databases, middlewares, abstractions, and clean code architecture that can handle real-world complexity.

---

## 💡 What I’m about

- 💻 **Code that grows with you** – I build with reusability, clarity, and scalability in mind.
- 🧠 **Architecture-first thinking** – My focus is on clean separation of concerns, secure token systems, role-based access, and adaptive service layers.
- 🔍 **Deep learning over shallow copying** – I believe in mastering the fundamentals instead of relying on frameworks to think for me.
- 🎯 **Problem-solving with purpose** – Whether it’s a frontend component or backend token system, it must solve something *real*.

## 🛠 Tech I Work With

### 🔹 Languages & Runtime
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js
- Python
- Bash

### 🔹 Backend
- Express.js
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- JWT, cookie-based auth, secure session management
- REST API design (adaptive + role-aware)

### 🔹 Frontend
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Modular DOM manipulation
- UI logic decoupling and utility libraries (e.g., [dummy-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dummy-dom))

### 🔹 Tools & Workflows
- Git & GitHub
- Vitest (Testing)
- ESLint, Prettier
- Dotenv/config separation
- Postman / Thunder Client
- Docker (learning)

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📦 [dummy-dom](https://github.com/mpho-shabalala/dummy-dom)
> A lightweight DOM utility library that abstracts document traversal and element creation. Ideal for clean vanilla JS UIs.

### 🔐 [Auth System][https://github.com/mpho-shabalala/standalone-jwt-authentication]
> Fully modular auth system using Node.js, Express, JWT, role access middleware, token blacklisting, and refresh logic.

### 🔌 [MongoDB database adapter API](https://github.com/mpho-shabalala/standalone-mongodb-adapter)
> Modular extendable framework built to adapt in nodejs backend API, provides utility functions that can be used right away, furthermore you can extend it using the already curated framework structure.

### 🎵 Music Player App (In Progress)
> A modular web-based music platform with genre filtering, playlist management, and server integration.
