# 🚀 3. Portfolio / Learning Actions

### Step 1: Isolated Systems (MVPs)
- **FinTech:** Mini-wallet with transfers + dashboard  
- **E-commerce:** Product catalog + cart system  
- **EdTech:** Quiz + progress tracker  

### Step 2: Add Domain-Specific Backend
- DB models (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)  
- API endpoints for CRUD, authentication, transactions  

### Step 3: Add Advanced Features
- **FinTech:** Fraud rules, analytics dashboards, notifications  
- **E-commerce:** Order lifecycle, inventory management, discounts  
- **EdTech:** Gamification, recommendation, analytics  

### Step 4: Deploy & Test
- Containerize with Docker → deploy on Render / Railway  
- Add testing (unit + integration)  
- Use CI/CD to automate deployment & test runs  

### Step 5: Combine Systems
- Integrate wallet with e-commerce checkout  
- Add course subscription payments (FinTech + EdTech)  
- Unified dashboard across domains

# ⚡ Final Notes

This repo represents my **journey from a general coder to a domain-aware engineer and future systems architect**.  

- **Core Principle:** Code = fuel; Domain knowledge = direction.  
- **Goal:** Build isolated, reusable systems → connect them → produce real-world, sector-ready applications.  

Feel free to browse, replicate, or learn from this roadmap.
